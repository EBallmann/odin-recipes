    <h3>Pork Fried Rice</h3>
    <p>This pork fried rice recipe is my revised version of another recipe.
         I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference.
         I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped carrot</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped broccoli</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup cold cooked rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add pork, green onion, carrot, and broccoli; cook and stir until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Stir egg into the skillet and scramble until completely set. Add pork mixture back into the skillet; stir in rice, peas, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger. Cook and stir until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
